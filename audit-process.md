# Smart Contract Audit Process

## 1. The Audit Process
      a. Scoping (determine the duration and pricing)
      b. Reconnaissance (initial code walkthrough, use tools)
      c. Vulnerability Identification (identify vulnerabilities)
      d. Reporting (create a report on improving protocol security)

## 2. Protocol Fixes
      a. Fix issues
      b. Retest and add tests

## 3. Mitigation Review
   - Recheck the code for any new bugs

## Two Tests Before Starting a Smart Contract Audit

### 1. The Rekt Test Questions
- Do you have all actors, roles, and privileges documented?
- Do you keep documentation of all external services, contracts, and oracles you rely on?
- Do you have a written and tested incident response plan?
- Do you document the best ways to attack your system?
- Do you perform identity verification and background checks on all employees?
- Do you have a team member with security defined in their role?
- Do you require hardware security keys for production systems?
- Does your key management system require multiple humans and physical steps?
- Do you define key invariants for your system and test them on every commit?
- Do you use the best automated tools to discover security issues in your code?
- Do you undergo external audits and maintain a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program?
- Have you considered and mitigated avenues for abusing users of your system?
